# UPV Scraper

![UPV Logo](https://www.innoarea.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UPV-Logo.png)

> _Subjects scraper written in Python_

### Idea

The idea for this project came in June 2019. I was supposed to spend my next summer semester in Spain at the UPV (Universidad Politécnica de Valencia) and I was looking for subjects compatible with my curriculum. Why search the "old way" when Python can do it for me?

### Demo
